The aliens took over during ptsb class session
Fortunately I had watched 'Mars Attacks' multiple times. I knew just what to do.
I put on my Halloween gorilla mask and put a fishbowl over my head, to try to blend in with the new overlords. It wasn't great, but it would have to do.
but my expert disguse had a fatal flaw the Overlords had never seen a Gorilla or knew what a fish was and sent their special forces after me!
