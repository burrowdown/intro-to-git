Nick was so excited to start his journey as a software developer!
When all of a sudden, he tragically slipped on a banana peel!
He had a lifelong fear of clowns, so this made him irrationally fear that a clown might be around the corner
But apparently the clown was living rent-free in his brain, juggling with his anxieties
Some day, he would be the Ring Master of his own destiny
but today is not that day. And he is not the Ring Master of his own destiny.
