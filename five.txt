A man limped with his cane down the sidewalk.
He was walked for four blocks before getting to his destination which was the bakery.
The bakery had plenty of cakes but no donuts
"Doh!"  I exclaimed.  I guess I wasn't getting my breakfast here.
these annoying clowns keep honking their horns at me I REALLY WANTED MY PANCAKES!
This is the worst 99th birthday anybody has ever had. I'm going back to bed.
