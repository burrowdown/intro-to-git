Unhaunted houses are all alike; every haunted house is haunted in its own way.
there is a ghost who rules them all and goes by the name of Shewkitque!!
Shewkitque was a cruel poltergeist. She had endured terrible things. But those things pale in comparison to what she had done to others...
Due to terrible things done to her, Shewkitque made sure to tickle the feet of all bad children who didn't listen to their parents
For all those children would not get presents on Christmas day. Shewkitque was the punisher of bad children.
kids shouldnt be punished, and presents came after all.
