i am a correction officer on rikers island.
and my favorite inmate is known as old sparky blue shoes. 
He's in for hotwiring and stealing cars that have blue shoes in them, plus he's old.
His obsession with blue shoes started with his mother, who he last saw when he was four. She always wore a pair of royal blue Coverse All-Stars.
His obsession to the royal blue Coverse All-Stars was his only way to feel connected to his estrangd mother. He had collected so many pairs of various blue shoes one might say it had turned into an unhealthy obsession.
He turned into a mad monster collecting shoes and turned into the Shoe Monster
He collecterd so many shoes that he had developed mountains. Unfortunately the mountains of shoes would be his demise. One night he leaving his bed in the middle of the night to get a drink of water he stumbled jamming his toe which caused him to stumble in the mountain of shoes. This would cause an avalanache of shoes to come smashing down on top of him and he would never be seen again.
for that was his true self, all the shoes were his and all was right for him. The End

 for that was his true self and he would lord over all shoes. the end
