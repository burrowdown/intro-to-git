Once there was a man in an enchanted forest who had an abundance of chapstick, he was lost and didn't know what to do with the chapstick. 
The man dropped chapsticks on the ground as he went, so he would be able to track his way through the forest and know if he got lost. 
He found that he was quickly running out of chapsticks to use to use for aiding in his navigation. The further he continued the more bizarre the forest appeared. This was a strange place, a confusing place...
He eventually walked out of a pipe and found himself around a kingdom of mushroom. A Mushroom Kingdom if you will....
Mario was ready to find Peach, but knew he need Luigi
Luigi was no where to be find, he was looking for mushroom.
Luigi was off defeating Bowser and saving the world.
