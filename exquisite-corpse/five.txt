a great nap was taken but now yawning is non stop
soon i will be crashing and traveling into another universe.
So, I need to see a doctor in case I'm about to die.
Bad news, I have 24 hours to live it up, let's see where this takes me.
I'm going to have to spend this day, my last day on this earth to be best of my ability. This is going to be a day spend around all those I love, and we are going to laugh. We are going to cry. But most of all, we are going to love each other.
I'm making the most of it, because I know for sure I'm about to go to hell
and then the man yelled "Thank you Mario"
