We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.
As the drugs took over my body, i felt the urge to go for a swim.
After quenching my thirst, i felt the urge to go for a swim.
I jumped into the swamp for a swim but felt something slither up my leg.
So I nearly broke my neck to hightail it to the shore.
I ran back home and had a sandwich then never went into the ocean again.
