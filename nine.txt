once upon a time a software developer teacher found a laptop 
Thinking it was a regular old MacBook, upon pressing the power button
The computer transformed into a robot mech. It exclaims "I will destroy the world".
Then it actually did it! One thing you can say for robot mechs, they are good for their word.
After this success, the robot mechs were given full citizenship and the right to vote.
and everyone lived happily ever after. :D
