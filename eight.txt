Once upon a time, in a land far, far away or not so far...
There was a dude, who enjoyed cartwheels and jumping jacks :)
He practiced every day so much that soon he was the best in the land
He decided to join a tournament to prove just how good he was.
he won, had a sucessful life, and made lots of money.
and then he failed epically in front of all his friends and family :(
and he lost it all gambling
