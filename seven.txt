Once upon a time, in a very far away place.
There was a cow, who loved beans
It's name was Jack, he planted the beans and it grew into a giant stalk.
then the samll boy named wort pulled the sword from the stone, and was known as arthur the king of england.
3000 years later his great great great great grandson was known as king arthur king of the burger !!!!
He truly was the Burger King.
