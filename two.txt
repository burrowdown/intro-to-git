But everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked
Aang really wanted to defeat the Fire Nation, but he was so, so hungry
He considered skipping the battle and just ordering a giant plate of dumplings
But the dumplings were trash, and decided he wanted a nice steak from the cow farmer down the road.
So he went down to the cow farmer just to find he was the steak all along. 
This sent him into a rage, but rather than lash out with violence he channeled his feelings into making change, and started a workers revolution among the cows. After a period of civil unrest, they managed to strike an accord with the humans. There was peace between cow and man forevermore.
