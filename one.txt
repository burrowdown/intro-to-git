Maria never wanted to go to Burning Man, but Jack insisted.
"Awww come on! Let's go have fun! Remember, life is for free expression, not good impression."
"look man i have a family and bills to pay im not going to go white water rafting with you on a Friday"
"do you know what my wife would do to me if i blew my money on something so stupid. PRIORITIES MAN... PRIORITIES. 
but dont worry, we will be able to get together soon enough.....plus, i spent it all on girlscout cookies anyway......"
And so the story goes, one gets money, one spends money, one get cookies.  And everyone lived happily ever after!
