Mike came down with the flu one day, but he didn't have any tylenol in the house.
So, he figured he'd just tough it out... which involved a lot of dramatic moaning and him trying to convince the cat to go to the store for him.
The cat wanted nothing to do with him or his antics so he dashed away with his tail in the air.
The cat proceeded to do flips and kung fu moves on his enemies.
You wouldn't think that would work, but he was actually really badass
Everyone cheered and the world lived in peace, happily ever after, until the heat death of the universe.
