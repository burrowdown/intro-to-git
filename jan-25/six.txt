While dogs proudly toot once and act like they’ve invented comedy, cows are out here pumping out methane like they’re trying to single-hoofedly inflate a parade balloon.
Do you think they know methane is flammable? Are they trying to recreate the Hindenberg?
sounds like something is going to explode
oh nooooo!!! its going to blow !!! i told you stop giving theese cats milk!!!!
These tragic events inevitably built towards the ultimate CATastrophe!  See what I did there?  ;)
The cats rose up and overtook their human overlords. That's why humans are extinct to this day and the animals live in peace free from their tyranny.
